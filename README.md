# HackEDBeta2021
This repository contains my team's entry for the HackEDBeta competition, a 24h Hackathon ran by the Computer Engineering Club at the University of Alberta.
My main contributions included the original idea for data forecasting, the simple/exponential moving average calculations, and the creation of the graph that represented the historical crossovers of those moving averages.

## Inspiration
Inspired by data forecasting algorithms. 

## What it does
Forecast previous stock data and makes predictions on whether or not to buy the stock.
## How we built it
Using some libraries from matplotlib and pandas along with data structures and some conditional statements.
## Challenges we ran into
- Stock formulas used for the modelling.
- Interpreting the libraries used in python.
- What the user finds most beneficial with the API
- Most of us had little to no programming experience and we all had to do extensive research on python libraries and the stocks

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Managing to complete the project despite the fact this project idea came up 23 hours ago.

## What we learned
Some library usage in python and how to utilize the functions available in those modules.

## What's next for Stock API
This can perhaps be a building block on creating future forecasting models for stocks.
